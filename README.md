# tpkg: tiny package manager for MicroLinux
**WARNING**: tpkg is *highly experimental*, and it might cause damage to your system/data. Use at your own risk.

**How to use**:
1. Run "make", and a binary named "tpkg" will be generated.
2. Create a root directory somewhere non-critical. tpkg will operate on this
   directory as if it's the system's root.
3. "cd" into the root directory you just made, and run "mkdir -p usr/bin"
