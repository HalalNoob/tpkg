# Test Package Manager

tpkg: a simple shell-script package manager and a fork

no dependency checking. Kind of similar to Slackware's package manager.

It is not available at the moment, but you can adjust it according to your needs as it is very simple.

*warning: tpkg is highly experimental, and it might damage your data.
use at your own risk.*
