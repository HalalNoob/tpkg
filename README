tpkg: tiny package manager for MicroLinux
=========================================

WARNING: tpkg is *highly experimental*, and it might cause
         damage to your system/data. Use at your own risk.

How to use:
===========

1. Run "make", and a binary named "tpkg" will be generated.
2. Create a root directory somewhere non-critical. tpkg will
   operate on this directory as if it's the system's root.
3. Create the usr/bin directory by running "mkdir -p /path/to/root/usr/bin/tpkg_DB"
