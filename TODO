tpkg design
===========

# use the Linux filesystem and http requests to manage packages
# use directory structure & mkdir, touch, etc. as the installation database
# use wget to download packages. If returned 404 it means that the package is not found
# packages in the remote repo has a <pkg_name>.dep file, representing it's dependencies
	# packages that doesn't have dependenceis can omit the .dep file
